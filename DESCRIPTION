Description: A tool for obtaining the most informative combiantion of items given respondent and items parameters in an Item Response Theory (IRT) framework. 
    The item selection is made following one of three different strategies: (i) smart (i.e., the most informative items across the latent trait are selected), (ii) guided (i.e., the latent trait is partitioned in intervals defining the theta target), and (iii) cluster (i.e., the latent trait is partitioned in clusters defining the theta target). 
    In the latter two cases, the items that maximize the information at the theta targets are selected.
