Description: Implement different Item Response Theory (IRT) based procedures for the development 
        of static short test forms (STFs) from a test. Two main procedures are considered (Epifania, Anselmi & Robusto, 2022 <doi:10.1007/978-3-031-27781-8_7>).
        The procedures differ in how the most informative items are selected for the inclusion in the STF, either by considering their item information functions without any reference to any specific latent trait level (benchmark procedure) or by considering their information 
        with respect to specific latent trait levels, denoted as theta targets (theta target procedure). 
        Three methods are implemented for the definition of the theta targets: (i) as the midpoints of equal intervals on the latent trait, 
        (ii) as the centroids of the clusters obtained by clustering the latent trait, 
        and (iii) as user-defined values. Importantly, the number of theta targets defines the number of items included in the STF.
        For further details on the procedure, please refer to Epifania, Anselmi & Robusto (2022) <doi:10.1007/978-3-031-27781-8_7>.
